CATSORG
=======

A simple pets adoption/shelter portal implementation leveraging Petfinder's API and Google's App Engine.

The codebase has been built for reuse with other Petfinder.com shelters, via an admin/cms/configuration tool for shelter specific information. Please note that Petfinder.com requires that their API be used only for non-commercial promotion of shelters and adoptable pets (see their terms). If you are interested in reusing this for your own shelter, please feel free to reach out to get started.
